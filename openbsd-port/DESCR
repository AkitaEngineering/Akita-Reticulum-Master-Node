Reticulum is a modern, cryptography-based network stack designed for
resilience and independence from centralized infrastructure. It can
operate over various bearers like radio, LoRa, packet radio, serial
links, or IP networks (UDP/TCP).

This package provides an integrated deployment ("Akita Node") for OpenBSD,
including the core Reticulum daemon (rnsd), command-line utilities, an rc.d
service script with dynamic PF anchor integration, and documentation.
