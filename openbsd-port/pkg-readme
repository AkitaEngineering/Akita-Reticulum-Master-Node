| Akita Reticulum Master Node (akita-rns package)                       |
+=======================================================================

Thank you for installing the Akita Reticulum integrated deployment package.

Verification Required:
---------------------
Before proceeding, please ensure you have verified:
- User/Group ID: The _reticulum user was assigned UID/GID 902 (placeholder).
  Confirm this was free in /usr/ports/infrastructure/db/user.list on your
  system when the port was built.
- py-serial Path: The port depends on 'comms/py-serial' (placeholder).
  Confirm this is the correct path on your system using 'pkg_info -Q py-serial'.
If these differ, the port may need rebuilding with corrections to the Makefile.

Configuration:
--------------
1. Create Storage Directory (if needed):
   Reticulum needs a writable directory for keys/data.
   # mkdir -p /var/reticulum/storage
   # chown _reticulum:_reticulum /var/reticulum /var/reticulum/storage
   # chmod 700 /var/reticulum /var/reticulum/storage

2. Copy and Edit Reticulum Config:
   # cp /usr/local/share/examples/akita-rns/reticulum-config/config.sample \
        /etc/reticulum/config
   Edit /etc/reticulum/config:
   - Set 'sharing_scope: system' (REQUIRED for status integration).
   - Set 'storage_path: /var/reticulum/storage' (or your chosen path).
   - Define your Reticulum interfaces (UDP, Serial, TUN, etc.).
   Refer to reticulum-config(5) man page and official RNS docs.

Dynamic Firewall Rules (pf):
----------------------------
This package uses a helper script to automatically generate basic pf(4)
rules based on the interfaces enabled in /etc/reticulum/config.

Setup Required (ONCE):
1. Create the pf anchor directory (if needed):
   # mkdir -p /etc/pf.anchors

2. Add the following lines ONCE to your main /etc/pf.conf file:

   # Anchor for Reticulum rules managed by rc.d script
   anchor "akita-rnsd"
   load anchor "akita-rnsd" from "/etc/pf.anchors/akita-rnsd"

3. Reload your pf rules:
   # pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

The service script will manage rules in /etc/pf.anchors/akita-rnsd.
Review generated rules and the helper script
(/usr/local/libexec/akita-rns/generate_pf_rules.py). This feature
requires the 'databases/py-yaml' package (installed as a dependency).

Service Management (rc.d):
-------------------------
1. Copy the rc.d script:
   # cp /usr/local/share/examples/akita-rns/rc.d/akita-rnsd /etc/rc.d/akita-rnsd
   # chmod +x /etc/rc.d/akita-rnsd

2. Enable and start the service:
   Add the following to /etc/rc.conf.local:
     akita_rnsd_flags="-c /etc/reticulum/config" # Or adjust config path/flags
     pkg_scripts="akita-rnsd" # Add to list of services to start on boot
   Then run:
   # rcctl enable akita-rnsd
   # rcctl start akita-rnsd

Check Status:
------------
# rcctl status akita-rnsd
# rnsstatus

Logs are typically in /var/log/daemon (tagged 'akita-rnsd').
